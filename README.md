I’d utilize the data to both train and assess various machine learning models. 
Subsequently, I’d choose the most suitable model based on a specific performance metric.
Using the chosen model, I would then validate its predictions for employees across two distinct locations. 
By comparing the predicted values, I could determine whether there is a significant salary discrepancy between these different geographical areas.
